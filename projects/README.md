## Project 1: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model

Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## Project 2: Plagiarism Detection

You'll apply the skills that you've learned to a final project; building and deploying a plagiarism classification model. This project will test your ability to do text data processing and feature extraction, your ability to train and evaluate models according to an accuracy specification, and your ability to deploy a trained model to an endpoint.
