# Udacity: Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Schedule

**[Software Engineering Fundamentals](software-engineering)**

- Introduction to Software Engineering
  - Learn about the course and meet your instructors.
- Software Engineering Practices Pt I
  - Part one covers clean and modular code, code efficiency, refactoring, documentation, and version control.
- Software Engineering Practices Pt II
  - Part two covers testing code, logging, and conducting code reviews.
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
  - Learn the basics of object-oriented programming so that you can build your own Python package.

**[Machine Learning in Production](ml-production)**

- Introduction to Deployment
  - This lesson will familiarizing the student with cloud and deployment terminology along with demonstrating how deployment fits within the machine learning workflow.
- Building a Model using SageMaker
  - Learn how to use Amazon's SageMaker service to predict Boston housing prices using SageMaker's built-in XGBoost algorithm.
- Deploying and Using a Model
  - In this lesson students will learn how to deploy a model using SageMaker and how to make use of their deployed model with a simple web application.
- Hyperparameter Tuning
  - In this lesson students will see how to use SageMaker's automatic hyperparameter tuning tools on the Boston housing prices model from lesson 2 and with a sentiment analysis model.
- Updating a Model
  - In this lesson students will learn how to update their model to account for changes in the underlying data used to train their model.

**Machine Learning, Case Studies**

- Population Segmentation
  - Train and deploy unsupervised models(PCA and k-means clustering) to group US counties by similarities and differences. Visualize the trained model attributes and interpret the results.
- Payment Fraud Detection
  - Train a linear model to do credit card fraud detection. Improve the model by accounting for class imbalance in the training data and tuning for a specific performance metric.
- Interview Segment: SageMaker as a Tool & the Future of ML
  - If you're interested in how SageMaker has developed to serve businesses and learners, take a look at this short interview segment with Dan Mbanga.
- Deploying Custom Models
  - Design and train a custom PyTorch classifier by writing a training script. This is an especially useful skill for tasks that cannot be easily solved by built-in algorithms.
- Time-Series Forecasting
  - Learn how to format time series data into context(input) and prediction(output) data, and train the built-in algorithm, DeepAR; this uses an RNN to find recurring patterns in time series data.
